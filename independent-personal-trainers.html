</table><p>This Training Session category is designed to provide you with a place to train your Clients with no long term commitments required on either your or their behalf. This option is great for Clients with hectic, inconsistent, schedules. Any  Clients who fall under this category are not permitted to participate in Group Training Sessions.</p>
<h3 id="category-ii-cat-ii---esf-member-training-session">Category II (CAT II) - ESF Member Training Session</h3>
<p><strong>Fee for Client:</strong> Active membership (any)<br>
<strong>Fee for Trainer:</strong> Active membership (any)<br>
<strong>Facility usage fee per Client per Training Session:</strong> 0 VND</p>
<p>This Training Session category is the most cost effective for you as a Trainer since We charge no facility usage fees. Additionally, there is a greater potential for you to realize increased revenue by keeping your Client invested in and committed to more frequent training sessions. Group Training Sessions are also permitted for all Clients who fall under this category.</p>
<p>Simply put, facility usage fees are waived for an ESF member who trains other ESF members.</p>

<h3 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Each Trainer may have Clients whose preferred payment terms categorize them into one or more of the above Training Session categories. If a Trainer has a Client whose usage of our facilities requires a facility usage fee, the payment of that fee is required at the start of each Training Session, or at the start of all consecutively scheduled Training Sessions each day. Perpetual failure to settle facility usage fees each day may result in the prohibition of all future Training Sessions for the indebted Trainer and/or the garnishment of those fees from prepaid membership dues (if any) paid by the Trainer. The facility usage fee may be refunded to the Trainer in the event that a Training Session does not begin as scheduled.</p>
<p>Trainers are liable for the payment of all facility usage fees accrued by the initiation of a Training Session with a Client who does not have an active ESF membership at the time of the Training Session. The Trainer will be responsible for all facility usage fees accrued in the event that a previous ESF member fails to renew their membership and engages in a Category I Training Session with the Trainer. The facility usage fee will be refunded to the Trainer if the Client in question renews their ESF membership starting from the date that the Training Session in question took place. If the Trainer does not wish to be held potentially liable for such facility usage fees, the Trainer must notify Us ahead of time and the Training Session must not take place until the previous member renews their membership.</p>
<p>In order to regulate and prioritize the usage of our facilities to best benefit our members, We forever reserve the right to forbid the Training Sessions of non-members for any reason. We reserve the right to restrict and/or prohibit any action that We construe to be an attempt to violate or circumvent any facility usage policies, guidelines, and/or this agreement. We will notify and give one warning to a Trainer whose actions are deemed to be in violation of their agreement to our policies and guidelines. Thereafter, failure to abide by our policies may result in termination, without refund, of some or all provided services.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this document and/or agreement and it’s associated policies at any time. In the event that We modify the terms of this document and/or agreement, the Trainer will be required to agree to the changes before their next Training Session can take place.</p>
