<h3 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Each Trainer may have Clients whose preferred payment terms categorizes them into one or more of the above categories. If a Trainer has a Client whose usage of our facilities requires a facility usage fee, the payment of that fee is required at the start of each Training Session, or at the start of all consecutively scheduled Training Sessions each day. Perpetual failure to settle facility usage fees each day may result in the prohibition of all future Training Sessions for the indebted Trainer and/or the garnishment of those fees from prepaid membership dues (if any) paid by the Trainer. The facility usage fee may be refunded to the Trainer in the event that a scheduled Training Session does not begin as scheduled.</p>
<p>Trainers are liable for the payment of all facility usage fees acquired through the initiation of a Training Session with a Client who is a non-member. The Trainer will be responsible for all facility usage fees accrued in the event that a previous member fails to renew and engages in a Training Session with the trainer as a drop-in customer. If the Trainer does not wish to be held potentially liable for such facility usage fees, he/she must notify Us ahead of time and the Training Session must not take place until the previous member renews their membership.</p>
<p>In order to regulate and prioritize the usage of our facilities to best benefit our members, We forever reserves the right to forbid the Training Sessions of non-members for any reason. We reserve the right to restrict and/or prohibit any action that We construe to be an attempt to violate or circumvent any facility usage policies and guidelines. We will notify and give one warning to the Trainer whose actions are deemed to be in violation of our policies. Thereafter, failure to abide by our policies may result in termination, without refund, of some or all provided services.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this document and/or agreement and it’s associated policies at any time. In the event that We modify the terms of this document and/or agreement, you will be required to agree to the changes before your next Training Session can take place.</p>
